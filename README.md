# SimpleGraph

A minimal Python implementation of an undirected graph using a dictionary of sets.  
Provides basic graph operations and simple algorithms for connectivity analysis.

## Features
- Add vertices and edges  
- Compute the degree of a vertex  
- Check if the graph is connected  
- Find connected components  
- Generate random graphs for testing  

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher  

## Project Structure
- simpleGraph.py is the library
- test.py is a demo use case
